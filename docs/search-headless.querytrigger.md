## QueryTrigger enum

Describes the ways a search can be executed besides user input.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare enum QueryTrigger 
```

## Enumeration Members

<table><thead><tr><th>

<tbody><tr><td>

</td><td>

`"initialize"`


</td><td>

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

Suggest


</td><td>

`"suggest"`


</td><td>

## Remarks

Used for search analytics. If a user supplied the search query, do not include a QueryTrigger.

## Example

A Search site may be configured to perform a search for 'What services do you offer?' when the page loads. Because that query is a default query rather than a user-supplied query, the Initialize QueryTrigger should be included in the request.
